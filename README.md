# OriginsContent
As the description says, this is ContentContent, but for Origins SMP. It adds a few placeholders and other items for the server.
## Additions
- Obscurer
- Shattered Orb of Origin
- Eternal Crystal

  As above, no functionality without the datapack, but with it this orb will randomise your origin.
- Placeholder Item 1-9

  9 placeholder items with a texture I made in 15 seconds. They do nothing, and are for Harry to do his own bidding.
  Items 6, 7, 8, and 9 can be equipped in the head, chest, legs, and feet slot seperately.
- Emotional Support Perkeo

  It's an easter egg. What else can I say?

None of the above are obtainable in survival*, and most will not appear in recipe viewers as they are placeholders.
